# Ephemeral-drainages
Analysis of Sonoran Desert ephemeral drainage geomorphology and plant communities.

An analysis of ephemeral drainage geomorpholoy and plant communities in the White Tank Mountains west of Phoenix, AZ in the Sonoran Desert.  This study looked at the distrubution of plants and plant communities, both within the drainage and in adjacent uplands.  The examined ephemeral drainage emerged from a canyon on the west side of the White Tank Mountains, extended along the west sloping bajada which was composed of four different geomorphic surfaces, and terminated at its base in the Hassayampa River (a larger regional scale ephemeral drainage).  Geomorphic surfaces composing the bajada were identified as providing the strongest factor in explaining channel geomorphology and plant communities in both the drainage and adjacent upland community.  Four different channel morphology types were identified verified with PERMANOVA pairwise comparison (p-value < 0.005).

    <em>Multidimensional scaling ordination with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure identified four channel morphology categories determined by geomorphic surface (0.9 MDS stress, PERMANOVA p-value < 0.005). </em>
